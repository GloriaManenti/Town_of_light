		<!-- Important note!: for my assignment I have created a website for promoting a game called "the town of lights" that I found on the internet, and which is going to be released on Feb 2016. Although the game has got its own website, here I have created a new one with new contents and format based on the requirements of assignment 2. 
		The  photos and the video that I have used are the ones of this game. 
		I have used twitter bootstrap css library beside the style.css file that I have created to customize some of the styles.
		Regarding the SEO, I have used google keyword planner to find the most important related keywords and I have included them in keywords and description meta tags.
		I have used iframes for embedding both the trailer video and the map.
		I have also included a javascript file called "slideshowmaker.js" which changes the first image and accordingly creates a slideshow.

					<p class="mainText"> The idea of the game was developed in 2011, when the developers found out that near their Italian hometown there had been an asylum, one of the biggest of all Italy. The place seemed immediately the perfect setting for a videogame, and the game ends up being also an historical documentary based on real happenings. The result of a very creative process, Town of light is an innovative game, which combines a personal experience told in first person with a realistic setting. Instead of being surrounded by monsters and dangers, the player experiences the same feelings of terror and despair patients felt inside the former psychiatric hospital a century ago. </p>

The programmers wanted to raise awareness of depression and the result is not the traditional horror game, but it is much more than that: it is a complete gameplay experience that allows major changes in the main story and different possible endings. </p>
